This is where all my materials for Gene 312 Programming for Biostatiticians will go. 

Hello World, 

I am Leslie, a Masters candidate for the Human Genomic and Genetic Data Analysis Program at Keck Graduate Institute. I'm interested in implementing machine learning applications to find genetic variances within the genome -- this would make all genetic data analysts incredibly happy as they don't have to painfully weave through each base to find the genetic mutations. I am anticipated to graduate in 2020, so please feel free to employ me! 

Best, 
Leslie C.
